This project is the "Recipes" project from TOP HTML Foundations section, where I will demonstrate my skills of being able to write in HTML5 and create a website which has different pages that highlight my ability to embed images and links into the page, use different elements and attributes for purposes such as boldening text and to showcase my use of absolute and relative links by directing to another webpage which includes a recipe.
