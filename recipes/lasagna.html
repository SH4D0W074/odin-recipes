    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There is something irresistibly comforting about a bubbling tray of homemade lasagna coming out of the oven. Layer after layer of rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel, al dente pasta, and melted cheese come together in perfect harmony. Whether it's a classic Italian-style version or a creative twist with veggies or different cheeses, lasagna is the ultimate crowd-pleaser for family dinners or special occasions.</p>
    <p>What makes lasagna truly special is the balance of textures and flavors — savory, cheesy, saucy, and satisfying. The longer it bakes, the more the layers meld together, creating that golden, crispy top we all love. Serve it with a side of garlic bread and a simple salad, and you've got a warm, hearty meal that never fails to hit the spot.</p>
