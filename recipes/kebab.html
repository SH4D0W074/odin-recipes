    <h2 class="subheading">Description</h2>
    <p>If you're looking to spice up your next outdoor gathering, Indian-style seekh kebabs are a must-try. These lamb kebabs are packed with bold spices and herbs that bring out rich, smoky flavors once they're grilled. With a crisp exterior and tender, juicy inside, they’re the perfect mix of heat and savoriness — a flavor explosion in every bite.
    Traditionally made with minced lamb, fresh cilantro, onions, garlic, and a blend of warming spices like cumin and garam masala, seekh kebabs are not only delicious but deeply rooted in South Asian culinary culture. Whether served as appetizers with mint chutney or wrapped in naan as a full meal, these kebabs are sure to be a hit at any party or family dinner.
