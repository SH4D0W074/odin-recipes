    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If you're looking to spice up your next outdoor gathering, Indian-style seekh kebabs are a must-try. These lamb kebabs are packed with bold spices and herbs that bring out rich, smoky flavors once they're grilled. With a crisp exterior and tender, juicy inside, they’re the perfect mix of heat and savoriness — a flavor explosion in every bite.
    Traditionally made with minced lamb, fresh cilantro, onions, garlic, and a blend of warming spices like cumin and garam masala, seekh kebabs are not only delicious but deeply rooted in South Asian culinary culture. Whether served as appetizers with mint chutney or wrapped in naan as a full meal, these kebabs are sure to be a hit at any party or family dinner.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds lean ground lamb</li>
        <li>2 medium onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh mint leaves, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 cup coriander, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 tbsp ginger paste</li>
        <li>1 tbsp green chile paste</li>
        <li>2 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>2 tsp ground coriander</li>
        <li>2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix ground lamb, onions, mint, cilantro, ginger paste, and chile paste together in a large bowl. Season with cumin, coriander, paprika, salt, and cayenne. Cover and chill in the refrigerator for 2 hours. Soak skewers in cold water.</li>
        <li>Divide lamb mixture into 8 equal portions; mold portions onto skewers to form a sausage shape. Refrigerate skewers until you are ready to grill.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and brush the grate liberally with oil.</li>
        <li>Cook skewers on the preheated grill, turning frequently, until nicely browned on all sides and meat is no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
