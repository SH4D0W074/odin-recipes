    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken chow mein is the ultimate stir-fry comfort dish — fast, flavorful, and endlessly satisfying. Tender strips of chicken are tossed with crisp vegetables and golden noodles in a savory soy-based sauce that brings everything together with just the right amount of umami. It&apos;s the kind of meal that&apos;s both light and filling, perfect for busy weeknights or when you&apos;re craving takeout-style flavor at home.</p>
    <p>What sets chow mein apart is the texture: slightly chewy noodles with crispy edges, juicy chicken, and fresh veggies like bell peppers, carrots, and cabbage, all stir-fried to perfection. It&apos;s a dish that delivers on both taste and speed — ready in under 30 minutes but packed with bold, satisfying flavor. Pair it with spring rolls or enjoy it on its own for a complete, no-fuss meal.</p>

        <li>Pour chicken stock into the wok; stir in spring onions, soy sauce, rice wine, white pepper, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Mix 1 tablespoon cornstarch and water together in a small bowl until smooth. Pour into the wok. Stir in oyster sauce. Add chicken and bean sprouts; cook and stir until chicken is tender and sauce is thickened, about 5 minutes. Serve over noodles.</li>
